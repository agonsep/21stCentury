# Deployment Guide for First Node App

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Railway (Recommended)
**Best for:** Full-stack apps with database
**Cost:** Free tier available
**Pros:** Easy setup, supports both frontend and backend, database hosting

1. **Prepare your app:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Create Railway account:** https://railway.app
3. **Deploy from GitHub:**
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Railway will auto-detect and deploy both services
   - Set environment variables in Railway dashboard

4. **Environment Variables to set in Railway:**
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   DATABASE_URL=<Railway will provide this>
   PORT=<Railway will set this automatically>
   ```

### Option 2: Vercel (Frontend) + Railway/Render (Backend)
**Best for:** Optimized frontend performance
**Cost:** Free tiers available

**Frontend (Vercel):**
1. Connect GitHub repo to Vercel
2. Set build command: `cd frontend && npm run build`
3. Set output directory: `frontend/build`
4. Set environment variable: `REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-url`

**Backend (Railway/Render):**
1. Deploy backend separately
2. Set environment variables for production

### Option 3: DigitalOcean Droplet (VPS)
**Best for:** Full control, custom configurations
**Cost:** $5/month minimum

### Option 4: Docker Deployment
**Best for:** Containerized deployment on any platform

## Pre-deployment Checklist

- [ ] Create production build
- [ ] Set up environment variables
- [ ] Configure database for production
- [ ] Update API URLs for production
- [ ] Test production build locally
- [ ] Set up SSL/HTTPS
- [ ] Configure CORS for production domains

## Database Considerations

### SQLite (Current)
- Good for development and small applications
- Single file database (easy to backup)
- Limited concurrent users

### PostgreSQL (Recommended for production)
- Better for production environments
- Better concurrent user support
- Most hosting platforms provide managed PostgreSQL

## Security Checklist for Production

- [ ] Set NODE_ENV=production
- [ ] Use HTTPS
- [ ] Configure CORS properly
- [ ] Set up rate limiting
- [ ] Use environment variables for secrets
- [ ] Enable security headers
- [ ] Regular backups
